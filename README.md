In the provided C++ code for the to-do list application, three main data structures are used. These are:

1. *Struct Data Structure*:
   The `todolist` struct is defined to represent the tasks in the to-do list. It has two members, `id` and `task`, which respectively hold the identification number and description of each task.

   cpp
   struct todolist {
       int id;
       string task;
   };
   

   This data structure is used for storing the tasks and their corresponding IDs. It facilitates the organization and manipulation of task-related information.

2. *File Stream Data Structure*:
   The code utilizes file streams for input and output operations with files. It uses the `ifstream` and `ofstream` data structures for reading from and writing to files, respectively. These data structures allow the program to interact with the "todolist.txt" file, enabling the addition, display, search, and deletion of tasks.

   cpp
   ifstream fin; // Input file stream
   ofstream fout; // Output file stream
   

   The file streams play a crucial role in handling the persistence of tasks in the application.

3. *Standard Library Data Structures*:
   The code uses various standard library data structures, such as `string`, to handle text-based inputs and outputs. The `string` data structure is used to store and manipulate task descriptions.

   cpp
   string task; // Used to store task descriptions
   

   Additionally, the code employs standard library functions for string manipulation and input/output operations, allowing for efficient handling of user input and file operations.
In the provided C++ code for the to-do list application, the file stream data structures `ifstream` and `ofstream` are used for handling file input and output operations, respectively. These data structures are part of the C++ Standard Library's input/output stream library (`<fstream>`), and they enable the program to interact with files on the system. Here's a detailed explanation of how these data structures are used:

1. *`ifstream` (Input File Stream)*:
   - The `ifstream` data structure is used for reading data from a file. In the code, it is employed to read the contents of the "todolist.txt" file when displaying or searching for tasks.
   - It is created using the syntax `ifstream fin;` and then opened with a specific file using the `open` method, for example: `fin.open("todolist.txt");`.
   - The data from the file can be retrieved using various methods such as `>>` (extraction operator) for extracting data, `getline` for reading lines, and `eof` to check if the end of the file has been reached.
   - In the code, the `ifstream` is used in functions such as `showTask()` and `searchTask()` to retrieve tasks from the file for display or searching purposes.

2. *`ofstream` (Output File Stream)*:
   - The `ofstream` data structure is used for writing data to a file. In the code, it is utilized for adding tasks to the "todolist.txt" file and updating it when tasks are deleted.
   - It is created using the syntax `ofstream fout;` and then opened with a specific file using the `open` method, for example: `fout.open("todolist.txt", ios::app);` to append data to the file.
   - Data can be written to the file using the `<<` (insertion operator) for writing data, and the `close` method is used to close the file once the writing is complete.
   - In the code, the `ofstream` is used in the `addTask()` and `deleteTask()` functions to add new tasks to the file and update it after a task has been deleted.

By using `ifstream` and `ofstream`, the code is able to manage the storage and retrieval of tasks in the "todolist.txt" file, enabling the to-do list application to maintain and manipulate tasks persistently across different program executions.
In the provided C++ code for the to-do list application, the standard library data structures are used extensively to facilitate various operations such as handling user input, storing task descriptions, and manipulating strings. The primary standard library data structures used in the code include:

1. *`string`*:
   - The `string` data structure is used to store and manipulate text-based data, particularly for storing the descriptions of tasks in the to-do list.
   - It allows the program to handle variable-length character sequences, making it efficient for managing text input and output operations.
   - In the code, the `string` data structure is utilized for storing task descriptions entered by the user in the `addTask()` function and for displaying tasks in the `showTask()` function.

   cpp
   string task; // Used to store task descriptions
   

2. *Standard Input/Output (I/O)*:
   - The standard input/output stream (`cin` and `cout`) from the `<iostream>` library is used for handling user input and program output, enabling communication with the user via the console.
   - The `cin` object is used to receive user input, and the `cout` object is used to display output to the console. This is essential for interacting with the user and providing a user-friendly interface for the to-do list application.
   - In the code, `cin` is used for accepting user choices and task descriptions, while `cout` is used for displaying the menu options, tasks, and various messages to the user.

   cpp
   cin >> choice; // Taking user input for choices
   cout << "\n\t1. Add task"; // Displaying menu options
   

These standard library data structures are integral to the functionality of the to-do list application, as they allow the program to manage user input, task descriptions, and program output effectively, providing a seamless interaction between the user and the application.
